# Develop. This Employees website #

This project was made for Code Institue Data Centric Development Assignment
The aim was to 'build a full-stack site that allows your users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain.'

I have choosen to build a website for a construction company. This company before was using other sites like dropbox, emails and even paper. This site was to help the company to become 'lean'. Meaning instead of use a multitude of different sources, making one site for ease of access.
The company has grown from a tiny, to a medium company and as such wanted to become more professional to help the employees and owner in their day to day operations.

## UX ##
Develop This while small, has two distict groups, management and employees. As much, while management has full access to all content, employees has limited to information (Example: Other employees bank details)

### Employees ###
Employees should have full access and edit their own information. Employees should have access to common information about projects and other employees.
As such employees experience should be:
1. As a new employee, sign up with a welcome password.
    1. Give personal information such as name, address, date of birth.
    1. Give bank details.
    1. Give emergcy details.
1. Be able to get contact details about my co-workers.
